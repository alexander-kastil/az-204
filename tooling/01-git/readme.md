# Git / Github Essentials

## Configuration

Set User and E-Mail

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@yourdomain.com
```

Unset Credentials

```
git config --global --unset credential.helper
```

## Configure ignored files

To Configure ignored files add a `.gitignore` file to the root of your project. A valid `.gitignore` file can be generated at https://www.gitignore.io/

## Basic Git Commands

Init Git:

```
git init
```

Get Status

```
git status
```

Stage all files:

```
git add .
```

Stage a specific file and all TypeScript files:

```
git add file.txt | *.ts
```

Commit files:

```
git commit -m "your check-in comment"
```

## Branching

List Branches:

```
git branch
```

List remote branches:

```
git branch -r
```

Create Branch:

```
git branch feature/my-feature
```

Push new Branch to remote:

```
git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]
```

Switch to Branch:

```
git checkout [name_of_your_branch]
```

> Note: When switching branches it is always good advice to check the status with `git status` on a windows machine. When there are changes from other branches on the disk you can clean the branch using `git clean -f`

Merge Branch:

```
git merge [branch_to_merge]
```

> Note: You might have to switch to the branch that you might want to merge into before executing merge

## Checkout specific Commits

Get a specific Commit:

```
git checkout <sha1>
```

sha1:

![commits](_images/commits.png)

![sha1](_images/sha1.png)

> Note: This will result in a detached Head.

If you want to delete your changes associated with the detached HEAD:

```
git checkout master
```

If you want to keep the detached state save it into a new branch and continue from there:

```
git branch save-detached-head
```

> Note: You will have to switch to the branch you saved to afterwards

## Changing Branches

Saving work before switching the branch - alternative to stage and commit:

```
git stash | git stash push
```

List stashes:

```
git stash list
```

Use a stash:

```
git stash apply | git stash apply stash@{2}
```

Switch to Branch:

```
git checkout [name_of_your_branch]
```

Cleaning up after branch switches - ie to remove untracked files from other branches on local disk:

-n flag is used to perform dry run.
-f flag is used to remove untracked files.
-fd flag is used to remove untracked files and folders.
-fx flag is used to remove untracked and ignored files.

```
git clean -fd | git clean -f <FOLDER_PATH>
```

Update a Branch from master / main:

```
git fetch
git rebase origin/master
```

## Tags

Create Lightweight tag :

```
git tag -l v1.1.0
```

Create Annotated tag :

```
git tag -a v2.0.1 -m "fixed Bug on replaced data layer. do not use v.2.0.0"
```

List all tags:

```
git tag
```

Show a specific tag:

```
git show v2.0.1
```

Push tags to Remote:

```
git push origin v2.0.1 | git push --tags
```

Delete tag:

```
git tag -d v2.0.1
```

Checkout tag:

```
git checkout 2.0.1
```

## Remotes

A Remote is a GIT Repo on a Git Server, typically in the cloud, like GitHub.

Adding Remotes:

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/try-git/try_git.git
```

Pull / Push from / to repository:

```
git pull / git push
```

## Forking Workflow - Getting Updates for Class Demos

![forking-wf](_images/forking-workflow.jpg)

Original Repo could be: `https://github.com/ARambazamba/AZ-204` where `ARambazamba` is the `original-owner-github-username` and `AZ-204` is the name of the GitHub Repo.

### Listing the current Remotes

List the current configured remote repository for your fork.

```
git remote -v
> origin  https://github.com/your-github-username/reponame.git (fetch)
> origin  https://github.com/your-github-username/reponame.git (push)
```

Specify a new remote upstream repository that will be synced with the fork.

### Adding the Repo of the original owner as Upstream

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner-github-username/reponame.git
```

Verify the new upstream repository you've specified for your fork.

```
git remote -v
> origin    https://github.com/your-github-username/reponame.git (fetch)
> origin    https://github.com/your-github-username/reponame.git (push)
> upstream  https://github.com/original-owner-github-username/reponame.git (fetch)
> upstream  https://github.com/original-owner-github-username/reponame.git (push)
```

### Getting Updates

Fetch from Upstream:

```
 git fetch upstream
 git merge upstream/main
 git push origin main
```

## Working with Submodules

Add a Submodule:

```
git submodule add https://github.com/ARambazamba/FoodApp FoodApp
git commit -m foodapp-submodule
```

Updating a Submodule to it's latest commit:

```
git submodule update --remote --merge
```

> Note: I use submodules to include samples in classes that are used in different classes or to shorten / avoid path problems in devops

## Git-flow

GitFlow is a branching model for Git, created by Vincent Driessen. It has attracted a lot of attention because it is very well suited to collaboration and scaling the development team.

[Git-flow Introduction & Cheat-sheet](https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/)

![git-flow](_images/git-flow.png)

> Note: Require GIT 2.24.0+ - Check with `git --version`

Initialize repo for git-flow:

```
git flow init
```

Start a new feature:

```
git flow feature start <MY_FEATURE>
```

Finish feature:

```
git flow feature finish <MY_FEATURE>
```

Publish a feature:

```
git flow feature publish  <MY_FEATURE>
```

Start a release:

```
git flow release start RELEASE
```

Finish a release:

```
git flow release finish  RELEASE
```

# Getting Started

To avoid problems with saved credentials I recommend using an alternate browser or log of all accounts in your browser before starting the lab.

- [Get the Azure Pass Code from the GoDeploy Lab](../09-godeploy-lab)
- [Register your Azure Pass](../05-azurepass)

>Note: For some labs you will have to clone the github az-204:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/AZ-204-DevelopingSolutionsforMicrosoftAzure
```

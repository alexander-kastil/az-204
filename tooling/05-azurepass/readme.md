# Azure Pass

Use your Azure Pass Code to create a subscription with free credits at [www.microsoftazurepass.com](https://www.microsoftazurepass.com/)

> Note: Azure Passes can only be used once per e-mail account. Please do not use Azure AD Accounts with existing Azure Subscriptions - if you do so you will not get the credits and the code entered will be invalidated. If you are not sure register an new e-mail account at [Outlook.com](http://www.outlook.com) or [Gmail.com](http://www.gmail.com) and use it to claim the Azure Pass.
